# wifi-off
Small app to automatically turn wifi off and on on rooted phones.

### This is a work in progress, current status is: working, but very rough edges.

Functionality: Save Wifi SSIDs into a list of known wifis. If none of these are within reach, phone's wifi will be turned off. Based on nearby celltower IDs, the wifi functionality will be turned on again when close to any of your stored wifis.
The app needs root access, since on newer Android versions (9 and up) this cannot be achieved with non-system apps anymore.
Target audience for this app are people that want to save battery, don't like to have their phone's wifi permanently turned on, and don't want to have location services enabled to achieve this functionality.
